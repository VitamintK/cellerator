The MathSBML package for Mathematica provides facilities for reading 
models expressed in SBML Level 1 (version 1 or 2) and SBML Level 2 
(version 1, 2, or 3),  converting them to systems of ordinary differential 
equations, and solving and plotting the results in Mathematica.

Some features of MathSBML include:

- SBMLRead: function that reads an SBML file and translates
   it into a Mathematica data structure consisting of
   differential equations, initial conditions, variables, function
   definitions, event definitions, unit definitions and associations,
   and replacement rules

- SBMLNDSolve: function that solves the system of
   differential equations produced by SBMLRead using
   Mathematica's NDSolve. SBML NDSolve fully supports 
   models with events.

- SBMLPlot: function that generates a plot of the resulting
   solutions. Support of all Mathematica "Plot" options.
   
- SBMLWrite: read an SBML file and write a translation. The only 
   output formats currently supported are FORTRAN, HTML, and XPP.

- SBMLCopy: copy an SBML file, reformatting the text using 
   Mathematica's XML/indentation capability to make the file more
   human-readable.

- An SBML Model Builder that allows one to construct
   SBML models manually from Mathematica data
   structures, read or save SBML files, and load them into
   the simulator. The model builder supports SBML Level 2 
   Versions 1, 2 and 3.

- Documentation in the form of a README file, extensive HTML 
  reference guide, and function documentation within Mathematica itself.

MathSBML requires Mathematica 4.2 or above for full XML
compatibility. It will not work properly with earlier
versions of Mathematica. 

Support of differential-algebraic equations requires Mathematica 5.0 or 
higher.
