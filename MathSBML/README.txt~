MathSBML Installation Instructions

To Install
==========
Open the file installer.nb in your version of Mathematica and follow the instructions as they appear. 

Documentation
=============
The README.nb is quite old and based on a much earlier version of 
MathSBML. It will help you get started but does not reflect the
most recent functions.

The README.pdf is identical to the README.nb. 

The more recent functions are described in the hyperdocumentation 
which you will find in the doc/html folder of this distribution.
