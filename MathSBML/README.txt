MathSBML Installation Instructions

To Download Everthing and then Install
======================================
From the command line, run the command 

bzr branch lp:~/cellerator/MathSBML 

to create a copy of the repository. Then go to the new folder
and run the file installer.nb in Mathematica to install. After 
a successsful installation the download folder that you created 
is no longer needed. 

If you do not have bzr installed you can get it at:
http://wiki.bazaar.canonical.com/Download

To Install
==========
Open the file installer.nb in your version of Mathematica and 
follow the instructions as they appear. 

Documentation
=============
The README.nb is quite old and based on a much earlier version of 
MathSBML. It will help you get started but does not reflect the
most recent functions.

The README.pdf is identical to the README.nb. 

The more recent functions are described in the hyperdocumentation 
which you will find in the doc/html folder of this distribution.
