xCellerator installation instructions
================================================================================
revised 25 Feb 2011

(0) Mathematica must be installed on your machine. If you do not have Mathematica
	you will not be able to use xCellerator. Mathematica is commercial software
	that is avaiable from <a href="http://www.mathematica.com">Wolfram Research</a>.
	
	These instructions assume you are using Mathematica Version 7 or 8
	
	xCellerator may downloaded from <a href="http://www.sf.net/projects/xlr8r/">Sourceforge</a>.
	
 
================================================================================
Installation Method 1: Use Installer Script (All Operating Systems)
================================================================================

(1) Download xCellerator-x.xx-dd-mmm-yyyy-hhmm.zip from sourceforge
(2) Unpack the zip file
(3) You should see a new folder by the same name as the zip file but without the zip file type.
(4) Inside this folder look for a Mathematica notebook "installer.nb"
(5) Open installer.nb in Mathematica
(6) From the menu bar in Mathematica, select "Evaluation" then "Notebook" to evaluate the entire 
notebook. You will see a series of menus that you can answer then the installation will proceed
on its own after you tell it where to find the folder xCellerator-x.xx-dd-mmm-yyyy-hhmm 
(7) If there are any errors you can correct them with the manual installation procedure. 



================================================================================
Installation Method 2: Manual installation (All operating systems)
================================================================================

(1) Open Mathematica

(2) Type 

      ToFileName[$UserBaseDirectory, "Applications"]
      
    and note the name of the directory identified. Typical locations are: 

	On Mac OSX:
	   ~/Library/Mathematica/Applications/

	On Linux: 
	   ~/.Mathematica/Applications/

	On Windows Vista (it will be a hidden folder in your home folder) :
	   Application_Data\Mathematica\Applications\
	   
	On Windows 7 (also a hidden folder)
	   AppData\Roaming\Mathematica\Applications\
	
    For more details on system-specific folders see the <a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/guide/Mathematica.html">Mathematica Documentation</a>

		
(3) Copy the file "xlr8r.m" into the same Applications directory. 


(4) From within Mathematica type

	ToFileName[{$UserBaseDirectory, "SystemFiles", "FrontEnd", "Palettes"}]

	On Mac OSX this should be: 
	    ~/Library/Mathematica/SystemFiles/FrontEnd/Palettes/ 
	
	On Linux this should be:
	   ~/.Mathematica/SystemFiles/FrontEnd/Palettes/ 

	On Windows Vista this should be (also a hidden folder in your home folder): 	
	   Application_Data\Mathematica\SystemFiles\FrontEnd\Palettes\
	   
	On Windows 7 (also a hidden folder)
	   AppData\Roaming\Mathematica\SystemFiles\FrontEnd\Palettes\	   
		
(5) Copy the file xCelleratorPalette.nb into the directory identified in step (5).

(6) Install any desired plugins by copying the .m files from the plugins folder 
    in the distribution to the Applications folder identified in step (2) above.
    Please note that the copies of the plugins included in this distribution
    may not be the latest versions and only represent a minimal installation
    of these files. 


(7) You may have to quit and restart mathematica for the palette to become
	visible.  To use xCellerator, you should  evaluate the line

	&lt;&lt;xlr8r.m
	
	in your notebook before you evaluate any xCellerator commands. 

(8) See the users guide at 

	<a href="http://www.xlr8r.info/usersguide/">http://www.xlr8r.info/usersguide/</a>
	
    for further information. 
	
    [ A local copy of the html  user's guide is also included in the doc directory of the distribution. ]
