			<ol>
				<li><b>Mathematica</b> - Cellzilla2D has been tested with Mathematica 8,9 and 11. </p></li>
				<li><p><b>Cellerator</b>- Download and install the latest version (e.g. <span class="function">Cellerator-xxx</span>) from
				<a href="https://github.com/biomathman/cellerator/releases">Github</a>. Earlier
				versions at Sourceforge and Launchpad probably will not work. </p> </li>
				<li><p><b>xSSA</b> - is not strictly required except for stochastic simulations. Download
				the lastest version of <span class="function">xssalite-xxx</span> from
				<a href="https://github.com/biomathman/cellerator/releases">Github</a> and install it. Then after 
				installing it, rename the file <span class="function">xSSAlite.m</span> to 
				<span class="function">xSSA.m</span>. (It
				will be located in the <span class="function">Applications</span> subfolder of the 
				<span class="function">$UserBaseDirectory</span> folder To determine the location 
				of ,span class="function">$UserBaseDirectory</span> on your operatimg system, type <span class="function">$UserBaseDirectory</span>
				into any cell in Mathematica and press enter.)</p></li>
			
			
			</ol>
			
			</li>
			<li><p class="header">Download and install Cellzilla</p>
			
			
			<p>To get the latest stable version, download the latest Cellzilla file release
			<span class="function">Cellzilla-xxx"</span>
			 from the 
			<a href="https://github.com/biomathman/cellerator/releases">Github web site</a>. </p> <p>To install Cellzilla:
			
			<ol>
			<li>Unzip the download.</li>
			<li>Open the file <span class="function">installer.nb</span> in Mathematica.</li>
			<li>From the Mathematica menu bar select <span class="function">Evaluate > Notebook</span> and follow the 
			instructions on the pop-up menu.</li>
			</ol>
			
			</p>
			
			<p>[ Advanced users may wish to fork their own version of the 
			repository, which is located 
			<a href="https://github.com/biomathman/cellerator/tree/master/cellzilla">here</a>. Altrnatively,
			incremental versions of the code can be downloaded from the repository.] </p>

          <li>
            <p class="header">Create a Cellerator model</p>

            <p>Cellzilla needs a model of a network in a <b>single
            compartment</b>; this model is then automatically reproduced on a
            template that you will specify. Quick start instructions for xlr8r
            are <a href=
            "http://xlr8r.info/usersguide/Quick-Start.html">here</a>. Cellerator 
            arrows are illustrated <a href="http://xlr8r.info/usersguide/arrow-forms.html">here</a>.
            In addition, Cellzilla arrows that can also be included in the 
            model are indicated <a href="CellzillaArrows.html">here.</a>
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p class="header">Create a geometric template</p>

            <p>The template consists of a representation of a two dimensional
            tissue composed of cells, stored in a data structure called a
            <a href="Tissue.html" class="function">Tissue</a>. Each cell is a
            separate compartment in this data structure.</p>

            <p>You can use a pre-defined template, such as the ones picture
            <a href="Tissue-Templates.html">here</a>; look in the index on
            <a href="index.html">main Cellzilla web page</a> for functions
            starting with the name <span class="function">Template</span> to
            generate one of these.</p>

            <p>You can also define the tissue directly from an external
            template by formatting the data structure as described <a href=
            "Tissue.html">here</a>, or by reading from a PLY file or flat file
            tissue description.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p class="header">Populate your model to the template (static simulations)</p>

            <p>The easiest way to do this is with the function <a href=
            "CelleratorNetwork.html" class=
            "function">CelleratorNetwork</a>, which is used to generate
            simulations on non-growing, static tissue.</p>
            
  
          </li>

          <li>
            <p class="header">Run a simulation on the Static Tissue</p>

            <p>Run a simulation and plot the results, e.g., with <a class=
            "function" href="RunSim.html">RunSim</a> and <a href="SimPlot.html"
            class="function">SimPlot</a>. You may want to plot your results on
            a template with <a href="SimAnimate.html" class=
            "function">SimAnimate</a>.</p>

            <p>A simple example that does all of the above steps on a
            rectangular template using coupled simple harmonic oscillators is
            given <a href="SimAnimate.html">here</a></p>
            
            <p>The results of static simulations - e.g., the values of variables
            as a function of time - are computed entirely in memory and will
            be forgotten when you quit Mathematica. If you will need them in 
            the future they can be saved with the built-in Mathematica function 
            Save.</p>
          </li>
          
          <li><p class="header">Incorporate growth and cell division</p>
          
          <p>The function <a class="function" href="grow.html">grow</a> incorporates the 
           functionality of <span class="function">CelleratorNetwork</span> and <span 
           class="function">RunSim</span> when 
            cell growth and/or cell division is going to occur. (Note that cell growth and
            division are included only starting in Version 3.)</p>   
            
            <p>Because the tissue is constantly changing the entire system is 
            recomputed after each cell division. This leads to a heavy demand on
            computer resources. Consequently, rather than saving the solution
            internally in memory, it is written to disk after each cell division.
            These files can easily be recovered for later examination and plotting. 
            Several functions such as <span class="function">GetSavedFile</span>, 
            <span class="function">SimAnimate</span>, 
            <span class="function">ShowTissue</span> and 
            <span class="function">SimPlot</span> have interactive features that allow you to select the desired
            file and perform these functions. </p>       
          </li>
